# The Keccak Code Package

This project gathers different implementations of the Keccak sponge function
family. Its purpose is to replace the implementations originally in the
[Keccak Reference and Optimized Code in C][keccakrefoptc] with cleaner and more
flexible code following (an improved version of) the interface proposed in the
note ["A software interface for Keccak"][keccakinterface].

We gave an updated presentation on the motivation, structure and status of the Keccak Code Package at the [SHA-3 Workshop in Santa Barbara in August 2014][SHA3workshop2014] ([slides][KCPslides]).

## Summary

This version supports:

* the [hash and extendable output functions (XOFs)][keccakhashh] defined in [the FIPS 202
  standard][fips202_standard]
* the CAESAR entries [Ketje][caesar_ketje] and [Keyak][caesar_keyak].

Since the previous version (July 2014), the structure of the Keccak Code Package
has gone through some significant changes. These include:

* The internal interface at permutation has been improved and renamed
  into "SnP" for "state and permutation" (see [SnP.h](SnP/SnP.h)
  for more details).
* A variant of the internal interface "PlSnP" that supports parallel
  invocations of the permutation (see [PlSnP.h](PlSnP/PlSnP.h)
  for more details) has been added.
* The duplex construction has gained some extended functionality, including
  [multiple duplex objects running in parallel](Constructions/KeccakParallelDuplex.c)
  and taking advantage of PlSnP.

## Notes for implementors of the standard FIPS 202 functions

If you need to implement the standard FIPS 202 functions, the macros in
[KeccakHash.h][keccakhashh] provide an easy way to get started.

### Differences between Keccak and the standard FIPS 202 functions

Compared to the (plain) Keccak sponge function, the [FIPS 202 standard][fips202_standard] adds suffixes to ensure that the hash functions (SHA-3) and the XOFs (SHAKE) are domain separated (i.e., so that their outputs are unrelated), as well as to make the SHAKE functions compatible with the [Sakura][sakura] tree hashing coding.

[sakura]: http://keccak.noekeon.org/Sakura.pdf "Sakura: a flexible coding for tree hashing"

A brief summary:
  - For the SHA-3 functions, append the bits "01" to the message prior to
    applying the pad10*1 rule.
  - For the SHAKE functions, append the bits "1111" to the message prior to
    applying the pad10*1 rule.
When they refer to the functions in the [FIPS 202 standard][fips202_standard], the test cases in [TestVectors](TestVectors) include these suffixes.
